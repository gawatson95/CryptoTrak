# CryptoTrak

Cryptocurrency, a digitally-based form of funds, has become very popular in recent years with millions of individuals investing in stocks by purchasing shares of the various cryptocurrencies. CryptoTrak allows you to quickly understand the most important data associated with each type of currency utilizing color-coded line graphs and tickers. Plus, track your own investments — all in real-time.*

CryptoTrak allows users to sort coins by name, price, and their holdings. Add, remove, and edit your saved portfolio and track your overall portfolio growth with no extra steps. Visually track the your favorite cryptocurrency’s past week’s capital with an animated line graph conveniently color-coded.

Dark mode in this app has been given a special and exciting user experience with now brighter colors. This app has also been optimized for performance by utilizing background threads and light usage of local storage for images to drastically reduce memory usage and consumption of cellular data.
